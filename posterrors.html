      <h2>Surfacing Post Errors Case Study</h2>
      <h3 style="text-align: left">Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        As a part of a larger project to tackle post reliability, the Surfacing
        Post Errors project served a dual purpose of providing our customers
        with more information through transparency on post failure and of
        providing our internal team a breakdown of said post failures to tackle
        in future phases.

      <ul>
        <li>
          I gained more experience speaking with customers, facilitating user
          interviews, and carrying out usability tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          I experienced the importance of flexibility and optimized task
          management to better tackle scope creep/change.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have a higher level of admiration for team members who work directly
          with our customers on a daily basis.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="text-align: left">Research</h3>
      <p>The problem we were addressing was that of post reliability. 
          The goal was to bring up post reliability to 98% success rates from a starting 
          point of below 50%. The bulk of the research and the initial work lied within the 
          code and how we were tracking and organizing the post failures and their reasons. 
          With the failures categorized, the team moved to group and translate the errors into 
          colloquial language that our customers would understand. By surfacing post errors, 
          we aimed to <ol><li>Provide transparency</li><li>Clean up workflows for reposting content</li>
            <li>Gain metrics to better serve our customers</li></ol></p>
      <h3 style="text-align: left">Ideation</h3>
      <h4 style="text-align: left">User Experience and Feasability</h4>
      <p>
        During conversations of the ideal user experience, I ran into new
        information that disclosed a feasability barrier. I was working on the
        assumption that our users would be able to get immediate feedback on the
        action they had taken whether it was editing content to fit requirements
        or renewing a credential. This immediate feedback would allow for the post to be rescheduled or reposted from the modal through the access of an action button. 
        However, given constraints, we were unable to provide that capability at the time. This shifted user experience flows as well as the visual design. It did complicate and elongate the process for the user.
      </p>

          class="img-fluid rounded"
          id="large-image"
        />
      <h3 style="text-align: left">Iterations</h3>

      <div>
        <p>
          A few key iterations for this project include that of a change caused
          by feasability restrictions that surfaced after the beginning of the
          research and design process. The initial experience for the post
          errors project relied on the premise that once the user has addressed
          the error through the button entry point in the modal, that action
          taken would be reflected automatically. The button would change into a
          green checkmark icon which reflects the resolved error. However,
          during conversations with the engineering team, it was disclosed that
          to have said functionality, the lift would be larger than initially
          understood. Weighing out the factors of time, resource, and value, we
          decided upon an initial release of a manual process with plans of
          creating necessary endpoints for automation for a later update.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/SPE initial flow.png"
          alt="Image showing two screen designs"
          class="img-fluid rounded"
          id="large-image"
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The iterated design is reflected below. The experience became manual
          in that once an error was addressed, the user would have to check the
          error message off. Upon checking off the item, the button, which acts
          as an entry point, would become disabled.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/SPE flow post feasability information.png"
          alt="Image showing two screen designs"
          class="img-fluid rounded"
          id="large-image"
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Having addressed feasability and fuctionality with regards to user
          experience. We did have a few iterations of the placement of specific
          elements. One of the decisions was in relation to the location of the
          checkbox icon. Through internal A/B testing and external A/B testing,
          we came to the conclusion of the third version with the checkbox to
          the right and separate from the card that holds the message, the
          button, and the support link.
        </p>

          alt="Image showing two screen designs"
          class="img-fluid rounded"
          id="large-image"
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Shown below, is the final design. Additional visual changes and behavioral changes were applied.<ol><li>The checkbox, when unchecked, is
          an empty square.</li><li>The button is disabled once the checkbox is
          checked.</li><li>The error message is strikedthrough once the checkbox is
          checked.</li></ol> 
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/SPE Final Modal with behavior.png"
          alt="Image showing two screen designs"
          class="img-fluid rounded"
          id="large-image"
        />
      </div>
      <h3 style="text-align: left">Result and Reflection</h3>
<p>After the release, we received many postive responses with regards to the usefulness of the surface level errors. Through the transparency, customers are able to pinpoint aspects of their content prep that cause post failure. For post failures beyond the control of Cloud Campaign, we are able to provide more immediate awareness of the issue. This shortens the amount of time our customers are in the dark.<br>This project highlighted the importance of communication whether it was with internal team members, customers, and leadership.</p>
