      <h2>CaptionAI Case Study</h2>
      <h3 style="text-align: left">Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        CaptionAI is an AI powered caption generator that improves the work flow
        of Cloud Campaign customers which range from large agencies to
        freelancers. The product has two forms, one as a standalone product and
        two as an integrated feature within Cloud Campaign's agency-friendly
        social media management platform. Given the two forms, the purpose, the
        considerations, and the pain points varied from the beginning.

          More minds at the beginning proved beneficial in several ways given
          the startup environment and one person design team
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep documentation up to date and accessible to all necessary parties
        </li>
        <li>
          Check in early and often with your engineers to discuss topics from
          feasibility to final visual design reviews
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h4 style="text-align: left">Research</h4>
        <h4 style="text-align: left">Ideation</h4>
        <p>
          For this project, I carried out a design sprint to the best of my
          abilities in order to gather more insight and heighten collaboration.
          As the only designer, there was often a need for initiating contact
          for brainstorming and ideating. I would like to note, this was my
          first time running a design sprint and given all that could have gone
          better, it truly was better than not having the design sprint.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left">Wireframes and Iterations</h4>
        <p></p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left">Visual Design</h4>
        <p>
          For visual design, when creating the high fidelity wireframes, I
          stayed consistent with the established brand color scheme. As for
          established patterns, decisions were made on a case by case basis.
          Should we keep the existing pattern or should we introduce a new one
          and implement backwards? I value consistency, but I am an advocate for
          new patterns when and where necessary, given they provide a smoother
          and more inclusive experience. This is also taking into consideration
          the time and resources available to implement the changes that follow
          a new pattern.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: left">Result and Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          This new feature has been successfully released and is being utilized
          by a noticeable majority of Cloud Campaign customers. With that, there
          has been an inflow of postive reviews with regards to the design and
          the functionality of the feature. Personally, this is one of my
          proudest projects at Cloud Campaign as I stepped out of my comfort
          zone and reached out for increased collaboration. This in turn led to
          a fuller list of design requirements, better understanding of the
          technical feasability, and clearer insight into user needs. This
          allowed for easier navigation when faced with scope creep and
          unforseen adjustments.
