      <h2>CaptionAI Case Study</h2>
     
      <h3 style="text-align: left">Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        CaptionAI is an AI powered caption generator that improves the workflow
        of Cloud Campaign customers which range from large agencies to
        freelancers. The product has two forms, one as a standalone product and
        two as an integrated feature within Cloud Campaign's agency-friendly
        social media management platform. Given the two forms, the purpose, the
        considerations, and the pain points varied from the beginning. For this
        case study, I will be discussing the integrated form.

        <li>How to handle limited space in the location of implementation</li>
        <li>
          How to integrate and introduce the implementation without disrupting
          the existing work flows of our users
        </li>
        <li>
          How to add value and satisfaction without hindering user experience

        <li>
          More minds at the beginning proved beneficial in several ways given
          the startup environment and one person design team
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep documentation up to date and accessible to all necessary parties
        </li>
        <li>
          Check in early and often with your engineers to discuss topics from
          feasibility to final visual design reviews
        </li>

        <h3 style="text-align: left">CaptionAI Integration or CaptionAI Product</h3>
        <p>
          When determining whether the integration or the separate product
          should take priority, we focused on where the immediate value would be
          added. This value being furthering our customers in their processes
          and the value in keeping the business up to date and relevant when it
          comes to AI. Taking into consideration aforementioned values, we
          decided to move forward with the integration first. To note, the
          separate product's value was in giving new and current customers an
          opportunity to test out CaptionAI and in providing leads for our sales
          team.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left">Research</h3>
        <p>
          The bulk of the research for this project was sourced from interviews
          between the product manager and the customers of the company. I was a
          part of several interviews as well where we held discussions to gather
          the needs and wants of our users. The pool of customers that we had
          access to was limited, however, efforts were made to diversify and
          include customers of various sizes and industries.
          <br> We focused on customers' existing workflows and what they expected 
          from AI in general then specifically, a caption generator. 
          We gathered information about workarounds that customers had developed. 
          Before thinking of solutions for the captionai project, we thought about the 
          possibility of addressing the issues causing the need for workarounds. 
          Can we take this time to address any of these issues since we will be 
          adapting code in this area during the implementation? Do we have enough resources 
          with regards to engineers and time to do so?

          /></div>
        <h3 style="text-align: left">Ideation</h3>
        <p>
          For this project, I carried out a design sprint to the best of my
          abilities in order to gather more insight and heighten collaboration.
          As the only designer, there was often a need for initiating contact
          for brainstorming and ideating. I would like to note, this was my
          first time running a design sprint and given all that could have gone
          better, it truly was better than not having one.
          <div class="d-flex align-items-center"><img
            src="/images/Scrum board-pana.png"
            alt="Vector Illustration showing scrum board full of post its"
            class="mx-auto"
            id="small-image"
          /></div>
          As previously mentioned, we were limited in our research size pool.
          This is where the design sprint helped gather more information.
          Collaborating with internal team members, who have been in consistent
          contact with our customers, provided key actionable insights. Many
          suggestions were made and of those, must haves were applied and nice
          to haves were documented for future updates.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left">Visual Design</h3>
        <p>
          For visual design, when creating the wireframes, I stayed consistent
          with the established brand color scheme. As for established patterns,
          decisions were made on a case by case basis. Should we keep the
          existing pattern or should we introduce a new one and implement
          backwards? I value consistency, but I am an advocate for new patterns
          when and where necessary, given they provide a smoother and more
          inclusive experience. This is also taking into consideration the time
          and resources available to implement the changes that follow a new
          pattern. <br />Given the pace in which projects were carried out, I
          often sketched designs on pencil and paper and moved them to Figma
          with the visual components in mind. I also wanted to provide a clearer
          picture to the internal team and diffuse the unfamiliarity with
          customers during usability testing earlier within the process. With
          that in mind, I recreated the existing platform on Figma as well.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left">Iterations</h3>
        <p> In this section, I would like to highlight a few areas of where and how iterative design took place.</p>
        <p>At the beginning, there was a decision to make regarding where the caption generator 
          would be implemented. The most logical and reasonable location was within areas where captions were 
          being manually written. There are three locations for caption creation, the main Create Content Modal, 
          the Post Now section, and the Create Content Modal within the Calendar view of the platform. 
          The following designs are from the main Create Content Modal. The next decision from there was where within the modal.
          <br>
          <br>The first option presented was the vertical scroll version shown below. This design placed the integration below 
          the existing caption input box. The button for the feature stood inline with the emoticon, multiplatform, and hashtag options.</p>
        <img
          src="/images/Vertical Scroll Version.png"
          alt="Image showing two screen designs"
          class="img-fluid rounded"
          id="large-image"
        />
         <p>The second option was the horizontal navigation version shown below. This option provided a more 
           visible button that would then take the user to a new screen within the modal upon interaction. 
           The new screen would move in from the right and a breadcrumb would signify the movement to the users 
           while allowing them to baivgate back to the main caption screen from the CaptionAI screen.</p>
        <img
          src="/images/Horizontal Movement Version.png"
          alt="Image showing two screen designs"
          class="img-fluid rounded"
          id="large-image"
        />
        <div><p>Cloud Campaign provides a feature in which users are able to create captions specifically 
          for the type of social media post. When implementing CaptionAI, we debated between the following 
          two versions. The first version shows all platforms in caption edit mode even if the platform 
          was not selected. The second version shows only the selected platforms. We pushed forward with 
          the second version as A/B preference test results reflected less confusion and higher learnablity. 
          Often times, less is more.</p>

          class="img-fluid rounded"

        /></div>

        <div>      
        <p>From Top left to bottom right, the image below show how the key screen varied as requirements were 
          added, removed, and changed throughout the project.</p>

        />
        <p>Added</p><ul><li>Platform specific selection dropdown</li><li>Token usage count</li><li>Hashtag toggle</li></ul>
         <p>Removed</p><ul><li>Token usage progress bar</li><li>Token usage count</li><li>Caption count info</li></ul>
        </div> 
        
        <h3 style="text-align: left">Result and Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This new feature has been successfully released and is being utilized
          by a noticeable majority of Cloud Campaign customers. With that, there
          has been an inflow of postive reviews with regards to the design and
          the functionality of the feature. Personally, this is one of my
          proudest projects at Cloud Campaign as I stepped out of my comfort
          zone and reached out for increased collaboration. This in turn led to
          a fuller list of design requirements, better understanding of the
          technical feasability, and clearer insight into user needs. This
          allowed for easier navigation when faced with scope creep, new
          information, and necessary adjustments.
